## Password-Generator

The password generator webpage will create a random password with your choice of length, from 8 to 128 characters, and choice of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters or all. Just follow the prompts and watch your random password appear in the box! :gear:

##Challenges
For this project, the user interface was provided and my challenge was to provide the interactive JavaScript to make the generator perform. The most challenging part for me was turning the random characters back into a string so they could be displayed in the text box. :triumph:
